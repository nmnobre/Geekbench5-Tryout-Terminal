# Geekbench 5 Tryout: Scores w/o leaving the terminal

A bash script for those of us who run Geekbench 5 in tryout mode but would still like to check our scores without leaving the terminal. Lynx, the text-based web browser, is required. Place geekbench5.sh in the same directory as Geekbench's binaries and make it executable.
